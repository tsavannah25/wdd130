        <h2>Boucing bubbles</h2>
        <p>Ingredients Needed
          Warm water: 1 cup
          Dish soap: 1/4 cup (Dawn dish soap is recommended for best results)
          Sugar: 1 tablespoon <br>
          Step 1)
          Prepare the Mixture:
          Pour warm water into a small bowl. Using warm water helps dissolve the sugar more easily.
          Add sugar to the warm water and stir until it is completely dissolved.
          Gently pour in the dish soap and stir carefully to combine without creating too many bubbles.<br>
          Step 2) Let It Cool:
          Allow the bubble solution to reach room temperature. This helps improve the quality of the bubbles. <br>
          Step 3) Get Ready to Bounce:
          Put on a winter glove on one hand. The glove prevents the oils from your skin from breaking the surface tension of the bubbles, allowing them to bounce instead of pop.<br>
          Step 4) Blow Bubbles:
          Dip a bubble wand into the solution and gently blow bubbles. You can also create your own wand using a pipe cleaner or wire.<br>
          Step 5) Catch and Bounce:
          Let the bubbles land softly on your gloved hand. Gently bounce them up and down. Avoid hitting them like a ball, as this will cause them to pop.</p>

        <h2>Knedic sand</h2>
        <p>Ingredients
          For your convenience in creating this recipe, we’ve included shop-able ad links to some of the products used; disclosure policy available here.
          2 1/2 cups colored play sand — you can also use colorful craft sand
          1 1/2 cups corn starch — if you’re outside of the US it may be called corn flour
          1/2 cup light-colored oil — such as vegetable oil, olive oil or baby oil
          Step Add play sand to a large bowl.
          Add cornstarch and whisk together to combine.
          Pour in the olive oil slowly, stir as you pour.
          When the mixture gets too difficult to mix with a spoon or spatula, finish kneading together by hand.</p>
