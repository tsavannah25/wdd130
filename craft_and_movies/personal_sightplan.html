    <h3>p1) In a world choked by toxic forests and ruled by fearsome insects, one young princess dares to believe
      there's more than death in the decay. Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind is a fearless windrider with a rare
      gift—she can communicate with the monstrous creatures that terrify the last remnants of humanity. When a mysterious
      airship crashes into her peaceful valley, it brings with it a deadly secret: the embryo of a forgotten weapon
      from a war that nearly ended the world. As empires clash and nature strikes back, Nausicaä must uncover the
      truth buried beneath the poisoned earth—before humanity makes its final, fatal mistake. Can compassion stop
      a war? Can one girl heal a broken world? If you love epic worlds, breathtaking animation, and heroines who
      lead with heart, this is the story that will stay with you long after the credits roll.</h3>

    <h3>p2) Wallace Ritchie (Bill Murray) is just a clueless American tourist in London, looking for a fun birthday night.
      His brother signs him up for an interactive theater experience called Theatre of Life, where Wallace thinks
      he’s the star of a spy thriller. But when he answers the wrong phone call, Wallace is mistaken for a real
      hitman—and stumbles into an actual international espionage plot. Oblivious to the danger, he bumbles through
      assassinations, secret agents, and Cold War conspiracies, thinking it’s all part of the show. Can one man
      accidentally save the world by being completely clueless? If you love mistaken identity, spy spoofs, and Bill
      Murray at his most delightfully oblivious, this comedy is a hidden gem you won’t want to miss.</h3>

      <img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/oi402PwT28kQkRvqNhiN944IUQL.jpg" alt="Down Periscope" />
    <h3>p3) "One rust bucket. One rogue captain. Zero chance of playing by the rules." Lieutenant Commander Tom Dodge
      (Kelsey Grammer) is the Navy’s most unconventional officer—and his last shot at command is a joke: a rusty
      WWII-era diesel sub, a crew of total misfits, and a war game rigged for him to fail. But when the Navy tells
      Dodge to “think like a pirate,” he takes it literally—dodging sonar, outwitting nuclear subs, and turning chaos
      into strategy. With a tattooed past, a crew that barely functions, and a rival admiral gunning for his career,
      Dodge has one chance to prove that heart, humor, and a little mutiny might just win the day. If you love
      underdog comedies, military spoofs, and Bill Murray-style charm with a torpedo twist, Down Periscope is your
      next laugh-out-loud mission.</h3>

    <h3>p4) "What if the sunshine came at the cost of someone you love?" Tokyo is drowning in endless rain. Hodaka,
      a runaway teen searching for purpose, meets Hina—a mysterious girl with the power to stop the downpour and
      bring out the sun. But her gift comes with a price: every time she clears the skies, she fades a little more
      from the world. As Hodaka falls for Hina, he’s faced with an impossible choice—save the city from disaster,
      or save the girl who changed his life. From the creators of Your Name, this is a breathtaking tale of love,
      sacrifice, and the storm we choose to weather for the ones we care about.</h3>

    <img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/rWYtghaUJSDvQm4jmXiCPXBHUdQ.jpg" alt="The Lego Batman Movie" />
    <h3>p5) "He’s the hero Gotham deserves… but definitely not the roommate it wants." Batman is back—and this time,
      he’s made of bricks. In The LEGO Batman Movie, the Dark Knight (voiced by Will Arnett) is Gotham’s ultimate
      lone wolf, fighting crime with style, sarcasm, and zero emotional availability. But when the Joker hatches a
      plan to unleash the worst villains from across the LEGO multiverse, Batman must do the one thing he dreads
      most: work with others. With a wide-eyed orphan who insists on being called Robin, a no-nonsense new police
      commissioner, and a butler who’s tired of his brooding, Batman faces his greatest challenge yet—learning to be
      part of a family. Packed with action, heart, and more Batman references than you can count, this is the superhero
      comedy that proves even the Caped Crusader needs a hug sometimes.</h3>

    <h3>p6) "The fate of Middle-earth will be decided—not by kings or armies, but by a hobbit with a burden too great
      to bear." As the armies of darkness march on Gondor, the last stronghold of men prepares for its final stand.
      Aragorn must embrace his destiny and reclaim the throne of kings. Gandalf rallies the forces of good. And Frodo
      and Sam, two small hobbits, inch ever closer to Mount Doom—where the One Ring must be destroyed before Sauron’s
      shadow consumes the world. But the closer they get, the heavier the Ring becomes. Temptation grows. Trust falters.
      And the line between hero and villain begins to blur. Epic battles, heartbreaking choices, and the triumph of
      courage over despair—this is the breathtaking conclusion to one of the greatest fantasy sagas ever told.</h3>

    <h3>p7) "Born a god. Raised a mortal. Destined to be a hero." Hercules, the son of Zeus, was meant to live among
      the gods on Mount Olympus—until a sinister plot by Hades, Lord of the Underworld, strips him of his immortality
      and casts him down to Earth. Still blessed with superhuman strength but unsure of where he belongs, Hercules
      sets out to prove himself a true hero and reclaim his place among the gods. With the help of a grumpy satyr
      trainer, a flying horse with attitude, and a sharp-tongued girl named Meg (who’s hiding secrets of her own),
      Hercules battles monsters, Titans, and his own doubts. But when love and sacrifice collide, he learns that being
      a hero isn’t about strength—it’s about heart. Packed with epic battles, hilarious sidekicks, and a gospel chorus
      that brings down the house, Hercules is a mythological adventure with a modern soul.</h3>

    <h3>p8) "She’s got 70 feet of magical hair—and a lifetime of dreams waiting just outside her tower." Rapunzel has
      spent her entire life locked away in a hidden tower, her only companion a woman she believes is her mother. But
      Rapunzel isn’t just any girl—her hair holds the power to heal and keep people young. And Gothel, the woman who
      raised her, is hiding the truth: Rapunzel is the long-lost princess of the kingdom of Corona. When a charming
      thief named Flynn Rider stumbles into her tower, Rapunzel seizes the chance to escape and see the mysterious
      floating lanterns that appear every year on her birthday. What begins as a daring adventure turns into a journey
      of self-discovery, danger, and unexpected love. With dazzling animation, unforgettable songs, and a heroine who shines
      as brightly as her magical hair, Tangled is a fairy tale that proves finding your way sometimes means breaking free.</h3>

    <h1>Bouncing Bubbles
      Ingredients Needed
      Warm water: 1 cup
      Dish soap: 1/4 cup (Dawn dish soap is recommended for best results)
      Sugar: 1 tablespoon
      Step 1)
      Prepare the Mixture:
      Pour warm water into a small bowl. Using warm water helps dissolve the sugar more easily.
      Add sugar to the warm water and stir until it is completely dissolved.
      Gently pour in the dish soap and stir carefully to combine without creating too many bubbles.
      Step 2) Let It Cool:
      Allow the bubble solution to reach room temperature. This helps improve the quality of the bubbles. 
      Step 3) Get Ready to Bounce:
      Put on a winter glove on one hand. The glove prevents the oils from your skin from breaking the surface tension of the bubbles, allowing them to bounce instead of pop.
      Step 4) Blow Bubbles:
      Dip a bubble wand into the solution and gently blow bubbles. You can also create your own wand using a pipe cleaner or wire.
      Step 5) Catch and Bounce:
      Let the bubbles land softly on your gloved hand. Gently bounce them up and down. Avoid hitting them like a ball, as this will cause them to pop.

        Trends in Doll Making:
        1. Sustainable Materials: With a growing focus on sustainability and eco-friendly practices, many doll makers are turning to organic fabrics, recycled materials, and natural dyes to create their dolls. By using sustainable materials, doll makers can reduce their environmental impact and create toys that are safe for both children and the planet.
        2. Customization: One of the biggest trends in doll making is the rise of customizable dolls. From choosing the fabric and clothing to selecting the hair color and style, doll makers are embracing the idea of creating dolls that reflect their unique style and personality. Customizable dolls allow for endless possibilities and make each doll truly one-of-a-kind.
        3. Diversity and Inclusivity: In recent years, there has been a push for greater diversity and inclusivity in the toy industry, and doll makers are following suit. Many doll makers are creating dolls that represent a wide range of ethnicities, body types, and abilities, allowing children to see themselves reflected in their toys. By embracing diversity and inclusivity, doll makers are helping to create a more inclusive and accepting world.
        4. Handmade Movement: The handmade movement has been gaining popularity in recent years, with more people turning to crafting and DIY projects as a way to express their creativity and individuality. Sewing a doll by hand allows for a personal touch and a sense of accomplishment that can’t be found in mass-produced toys. By joining the handmade movement, doll makers are connecting with a community of like-minded individuals who share a passion for creativity and craftsmanship.
