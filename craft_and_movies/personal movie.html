    <div class="box purple">In a world choked by toxic forests and ruled by fearsome insects,
      one young princess dares to believe there's more than death in the decay. Nausicaä of
      the Valley of the Wind is a fearless windrider with a rare gift—she can communicate with
      the monstrous creatures that terrify the last remnants of humanity. When a mysterious airship
      crashes into her peaceful valley, it brings with it a deadly secret: the embryo of a forgotten
      weapon from a war that nearly ended the world. As empires clash and nature strikes back,
      Nausicaä must uncover the truth buried beneath the poisoned earth—before humanity makes its
      final, fatal mistake. Can compassion stop a war? Can one girl heal a broken world? If you love
      epic worlds, breathtaking animation, and heroines who lead with heart, this is the story that
      will stay with you long after the credits roll.

    <div class="box purple">Wallace Ritchie (Bill Murray) is just a clueless American tourist in London,
      looking for a fun birthday night. His brother signs him up for an interactive theater experience
      called Theatre of Life, where Wallace thinks he’s the star of a spy thriller. But when he answers
      the wrong phone call, Wallace is mistaken for a real hitman—and stumbles into an actual international
      espionage plot. Oblivious to the danger, he bumbles through assassinations, secret agents, and Cold War
      conspiracies, thinking it’s all part of the show. Can one man accidentally save the world by being
      completely clueless? If you love mistaken identity, spy spoofs, and Bill Murray at his most delightfully
      oblivious, this comedy is a hidden gem you won’t want to miss.
      </div>
    <div class="box purple">"One rust bucket. One rogue captain. Zero chance of playing by the rules." Lieutenant
      Commander Tom Dodge (Kelsey Grammer) is the Navy’s most unconventional officer—and his last shot at command
      is a joke: a rusty WWII-era diesel sub, a crew of total misfits, and a war game rigged for him to fail. But
      when the Navy tells Dodge to “think like a pirate,” he takes it literally—dodging sonar, outwitting nuclear
      subs, and turning chaos into strategy. With a tattooed past, a crew that barely functions, and a rival admiral
      gunning for his career, Dodge has one chance to prove that heart, humor, and a little mutiny might just win
      the day. If you love underdog comedies, military spoofs, and Bill Murray-style charm with a torpedo twist,
      Down Periscope is your next laugh-out-loud mission.

    <div class="box purple"> "What if the sunshine came at the cost of someone you love?" Tokyo is drowning in
      endless rain. Hodaka, a runaway teen searching for purpose, meets Hina—a mysterious girl with the power
      to stop the downpour and bring out the sun. But her gift comes with a price: every time she clears the
      skies, she fades a little more from the world. As Hodaka falls for Hina, he’s faced with an impossible
      choice—save the city from disaster, or save the girl who changed his life. From the creators of Your Name,
      this is a breathtaking tale of love, sacrifice, and the storm we choose to weather for the ones we care about.

    <div class="box purple">"He’s the hero Gotham deserves… but definitely not the roommate it wants." Batman is
      back—and this time, he’s made of bricks. In The LEGO Batman Movie, the Dark Knight (voiced by Will Arnett)
      is Gotham’s ultimate lone wolf, fighting crime with style, sarcasm, and zero emotional availability. But when
      the Joker hatches a plan to unleash the worst villains from across the LEGO multiverse, Batman must do the one
      thing he dreads most: work with others. With a wide-eyed orphan who insists on being called Robin, a no-nonsense
      new police commissioner, and a butler who’s tired of his brooding, Batman faces his greatest challenge
      yet—learning to be part of a family. Packed with action, heart, and more Batman references than you can count,
      this is the superhero comedy that proves even the Caped Crusader needs a hug sometimes.

    <div class="box purple">"The fate of Middle-earth will be decided—not by kings or armies, but by a hobbit with a
      burden too great to bear." As the armies of darkness march on Gondor, the last stronghold of men prepares for
      its final stand. Aragorn must embrace his destiny and reclaim the throne of kings. Gandalf rallies the forces
      of good. And Frodo and Sam, two small hobbits, inch ever closer to Mount Doom—where the One Ring must be destroyed
      before Sauron’s shadow consumes the world. But the closer they get, the heavier the Ring becomes. Temptation grows.
      Trust falters. And the line between hero and villain begins to blur. Epic battles, heartbreaking choices, and the
      triumph of courage over despair—this is the breathtaking conclusion to one of the greatest fantasy sagas ever told.
      </div>
    <div class="box purple">"Born a god. Raised a mortal. Destined to be a hero."
      Hercules, the son of Zeus, was meant to live among the gods on Mount Olympus—until a sinister plot by Hades, Lord
      of the Underworld, strips him of his immortality and casts him down to Earth. Still blessed with superhuman strength
      but unsure of where he belongs, Hercules sets out to prove himself a true hero and reclaim his place among the gods.
      With the help of a grumpy satyr trainer, a flying horse with attitude, and a sharp-tongued girl named Meg (who’s hiding
      secrets of her own), Hercules battles monsters, Titans, and his own doubts. But when love and sacrifice collide, he
      learns that being a hero isn’t about strength—it’s about heart. Packed with epic battles, hilarious sidekicks, and a
      gospel chorus that brings down the house, Hercules is a mythological adventure with a modern soul.

    <div class="box purple"> "She’s got 70 feet of magical hair—and a lifetime of dreams waiting just outside her tower." Rapunzel
      has spent her entire life locked away in a hidden tower, her only companion a woman she believes is her mother. But Rapunzel
      isn’t just any girl—her hair holds the power to heal and keep people young. And Gothel, the woman who raised her, is hiding
      the truth: Rapunzel is the long-lost princess of the kingdom of Corona. When a charming thief named Flynn Rider stumbles
      into her tower, Rapunzel seizes the chance to escape and see the mysterious floating lanterns that appear every year on her
      birthday. What begins as a daring adventure turns into a journey of self-discovery, danger, and unexpected love. With dazzling
      animation, unforgettable songs, and a heroine who shines as brightly as her magical hair, Tangled is a fairy tale that proves
      finding your way sometimes means breaking free.
