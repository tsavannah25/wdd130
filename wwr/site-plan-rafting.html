    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Our website exists to promote our whitewater rafting business by
      showcasing our exciting guided trips, providing essential safety and
      booking information, and helping potential customers learn about the
      unforgettable adventure experiences we offer. Our goal is to build
      revenue through online bookings while sharing our passion for outdoor
      recreation and river conservation.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our target audience includes adventure-seeking individuals and groups,
      ranging from young adults (ages 18–35) looking for an adrenaline rush,
      to families and corporate teams interested in outdoor bonding experiences.
      These customers typically have moderate to high disposable income and are
      interested in outdoor recreation, fitness, and travel. Many are planning
      vacations or weekend getaways and want unique, memorable activities. Their
      needs include clear information on safety, trip options, pricing, and booking
      availability—needs that are often not fully met by other regional adventure
      sites. Most of our visitors will access the site via mobile devices while traveling
      or planning on-the-go, so our site will be fully mobile-responsive to support
      quick navigation and booking.</p>
